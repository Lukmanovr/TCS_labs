## How to contribute
If you ***do not have*** the repo on your machine:

- Make sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [hugo](https://gohugo.io/installation/), and any code editor installed ([VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is recommended, but you may use the one you prefer)
- Clone the repository **with submodules**: 
  ```
  $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/TCS-IU/TCS_labs.git
  ```
  (Note) If you have already clone this repo without submodules, run this from the source directory
  ```
  $ git submodule init && git submodule update
  ```
Now you can start contributing:
- To start the website localy, run
  ```
  $ hugo server --minify --theme=hugo-book
  ``` 
- The last line in the terminal output should look like
  ```
  Web Server is available at //localhost:some-port-number/ (bind address 127.0.0.1)
  ```
  Visit `localhost:some-port-number` in your browser to access your local instance of the website. Now all of you changes in the website's source code should be propageted automatically.
- You are ready to rock!!! Make changes and contribute!
- After you feel you have made enough changes, run <br> 
  [`git add .`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-add),<br>
   then <br>
  [`git commit -m "Your very informative message that describes the changes you've made"`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit). 

  Note that this saves and documents changes on your machine only.

**Important note!**

Make sure to run [`git pull`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-pull) before you make any new changes after you've pushed, so that you avoid creating merge conflicts.

## Pull requests
Now that you have made your changes, you will need to properly submit them so that no merge conficts happen.<br>
 To do so:
- Switch to a new branch *(if you haven't done that already)*:
  ```
  $ git checkout -b <branch>
  ```
  Ex: `git checkout -b lab11`
- If you have any changes left uncommited, commit them as ususal
- Push your new branch to the server
  ```
  $ git push origin <branch>
  ```
  It should push the branch normally. If not, send the error to the group.
- Now go to the [github repo](https://github.com/TCS-IU/TCS_labs)
- Press ["Pull requests"](https://github.com/TCS-IU/TCS_labs/pulls)
- Press ["New pull requests"](https://github.com/TCS-IU/TCS_labs/compare)
- Select the **master** branch on the left, and **<branch>** on the right. Make sure **base** & **head** repos are the same *(that is TCS-IU/TCS_labs)*
- Press "Create pull request"
- Describe what have you modified, maybe provide some suggestions for future imporvements
- Once done, press "Create pull request"
- Done! Admins will review your work and merge your changes into the main repo soon  

  
## Shortcodes
This projects uses a handful of shortcodes. Shortcode *(in a nutshell)* is "mark" inside your markdown code that enables certain features within its code block. For example, you can define a codeblock of LaTeX code that renders LaTeX formulas. You can also define a codeblock that describes a structure of a graph. Below are example of these two.

### LaTeX
How to write in LaTeX:
```md
{{<katex>}}
your latex formula
{{</katex>}}
```
This produces an inline formula. If you want to center your formula, use `display` property like so:
```md
{{<katex display>}}
your centered latex formula
{{</katex>}}
```
[Latex cheatsheet](https://wch.github.io/latexsheet/latexsheet.pdf)

### Mermaid (graphs)
How to create graphs:
1. [Take a look at Mermaid syntax](https://mermaid.js.org/intro/)
2. Pick a graph you want to use
3. Write neccesary code
 
**Ex:**
```md
{{<mermaid>}}
gitGraph
  commit
  commit
  branch develop
  commit
  commit
  commit
  checkout main
  commit
  commit
{{</mermaid>}}
```
This will produce a git graph. There are 12 other graph types you can use. Refer to [Mermaid documentation](https://mermaid.js.org/intro/) for examples.

### Other shortcodes
This project's shortcodes and their descriptions can be found in `layouts/shortcodes`. They all use the same syntax: 
```
{{<shortcode>}}
...stuff/..
{{</shortcode>}}
```
Try them out and see what you can build.
