## How to contribute
If you ***do not have*** the repo on your machine:

- Make sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [hugo](https://gohugo.io/installation/), and any code editor installed ([VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is recommended, but you may use the one you prefer)
- Clone the repository **with submodules**: 
  ```
  $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/TCS-IU/TCS_labs.git
  ```
  *(Note) If you have already clone this repo without submodules, run this from the source directory*
  ```
  $ git submodule init && git submodule update
  ```
Now you can start contributing:
- To start the website localy, run
  ```
  $ hugo server --minify --theme=hugo-book
  ``` 
- The last line in the terminal output should look like
  ```
  Web Server is available at //localhost:some-port-number/ (bind address 127.0.0.1)
  ```
  Visit `localhost:some-port-number` in your browser to access your local instance of the website. Now all of you changes in the website's source code should be propageted automatically.
- You are ready to rock!!! Make changes and contribute!
- After you feel you have made enough changes, run <br> 
  [`git add .`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-add),<br>
   then <br>
  [`git commit -m "Your very informative message that describes the changes you've made"`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit). 

  Note that this saves and documents changes on your machine only.
- To propagate your changes to others, run
  ```
  git push origin master
  ```
  *(Note for the experienced contributors) You can run `git push origin master -u` to make `origin master` your default branch to push and pull to.*

**Important note!**

Make sure to run [`git pull`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-pull) before you make any new changes after you've pushed, so that you avoid creating merge conflicts.
