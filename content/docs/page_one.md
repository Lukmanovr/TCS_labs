# Lab Session 1

## Introductory notes

Welcome to our laboratory exercises! Each week, you'll have the opportunity to work on hands-on projects and experiments that will help you better understand the material covered in class.

{{< hint danger >}}
**Important information**  

To make sure you're getting the most out of the lab sessions, we'll be assessing your performance in a few different ways and the final grade will be calculated as follows:

- Mid-term Exam (20%)
- Final Exam (30%)
- 2 Assignments (30%)
- 6 Quizzes (25%)

We understand that sometimes you may want to switch lab groups to work with different classmates. That's why we allow group switching under the following conditions:
- The group size limit is 30 students.
You'll need to get approval from the TA.

We're excited for you to dive into the lab sessions and gain a deeper understanding of the material. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to the TA or instructor.

**Policy and Procedures on Cheating and Plagiarism**  

Tests and Exams policy: If two or more students are caught
communicating for any reason during exams (including mid-terms)
they will be asked to leave the room and their exam will be failed.
Same will happen for unauthorized use of devices.

{{< hint warning >}}
**Report policy**   

If a submitted report contains work other than
student’s one it is necessary to **explicitly acknowledge** the source.
It is encouraged to refer and quote other works, but it has to be
made clear which words and ideas are property and creation of the
student, and which ones have come from others (which must not
correspond to more than 30% of the work). If two or more reports
show evidence of being produced by unauthorized cooperative
work, i.e. copied from fellow students, they will be all failed
without further investigation on who produced the results and who
actually copied.

## Lab #1 agenda


- Preliminaries - Sets  
- Formal Languages  
- Operations on Formal Languages  

{{< expand >}}
**Sets**:
In mathematics, a set is a collection of distinct objects, considered as an object in its own right. Sets are one of the most fundamental concepts in mathematics, and can be used to model nearly everything in the mathematical universe.

**Formal Languages**:
A formal language is a set of finite sequences of symbols, also known as strings, that are generated by a formal grammar. Formal languages are used in mathematical logic, computer science, and the study of programming languages.

**Operations on Formal Languages**:
There are several operations that can be performed on formal languages, such as union, intersection, complement, and concatenation. Union combines two languages into one, intersection finds the common strings between two languages, complement finds the strings that are in one language but not in another, and concatenation combines two languages by appending the strings of one language to the end of the strings of another.

## Preliminaries - Sets
### **Finite set**  

A finite set is a set that has a finite number of elements. For example, the set of integers from 1 to 10 is a finite set because it has 10 elements. In contrast, the set of all integers is an infinite set because it has an infinite number of elements.  


A finite set can be described, at least in principle, by listing its elements: {{< katex >}} A = \{1, 2, 4, 8\} {{< /katex >}} 
says that {{< katex >}} A {{< /katex >}} is the set whose elements are {{< katex >}} 1, 2, 4, 8. {{< /katex >}}

------

### **Infinite set**  

For infinite (even for finite sets if they have more than just a few elements) sets ellipses {{< katex >}}(\dots){{< /katex >}} are 
sometimes used to describe how the elements might be listed. An ellipsis is a set of three periods {{< katex >}}(\dots){{< /katex >}} indicating an omission:
{{< katex >}} B = \{0, 3, 6, 9, \ldots\} {{< /katex >}}

A more reliable way is to give the property that characterises their elements (also called **set comprehension**).
Set {{< katex >}} B = \{0, 3, 6, 9, \ldots\} {{< /katex >}} can be described as:
{{< katex display >}} B = \{x \mid x  \text{ is a non-negative integer multiple of 3}\} {{< /katex >}}
It reads: {{< katex >}} B {{< /katex >}} is the set of all {{< katex >}} x {{< /katex >}} such that {{< katex >}}x{{< /katex >}} is a non-negative integer multiple of {{< katex >}}3.{{< /katex >}}


------

### **Sets (notation)**

- For any set {{< katex >}}A{{< /katex >}} the statement that {{< katex >}}x{{< /katex >}} is an element of {{< katex >}}A{{< /katex >}} is written: {{< katex >}}x \in A{{< /katex >}}.
- {{< katex >}}A \subseteq B{{< /katex >}} means that {{< katex >}}A{{< /katex >}} is a subset of {{< katex >}}B{{< /katex >}}: every element of {{< katex >}}A{{< /katex >}} is an element of {{< katex >}}B{{< /katex >}}.
- {{< katex >}}\emptyset{{< /katex >}} denotes the empty set: the set with no elements.

To show that two sets {{< katex >}}A{{< /katex >}} and {{< katex >}}B{{< /katex >}} are the same, we must show that {{< katex >}}A{{< /katex >}} and {{< katex >}}B{{< /katex >}} have exactly the same elements, i.e. {{< katex >}}A \subseteq B{{< /katex >}} and {{< katex >}}B \subseteq A{{< /katex >}}. 


------

### **Sets (operations)**

For two sets {{< katex >}}A{{< /katex >}} and {{< katex >}}B{{< /katex >}}, we can define their union {{< katex >}}A \cup B{{< /katex >}}, their intersection {{< katex >}}A \cap B{{< /katex >}}, and their difference {{< katex >}}A \backslash B{{< /katex >}} (sometimes denoted as {{< katex >}}A - B{{< /katex >}}), as follows {{< katex >}}(\vee, \wedge{{< /katex >}}denote the logical 'or' and logical 'and' respectively).

- {{< katex >}} A \cup B = \{x \mid x \in A \vee x \in B\} {{< /katex >}}
- {{< katex >}} A \cap B = \{x \mid x \in A \wedge x \in B\} {{< /katex >}}
- {{< katex >}} A \backslash B = \{x \mid x \in A \wedge x \not \in B\} {{< /katex >}}  

Below, is a python code that shows simple operations on sets:

```python
# Define two sets
A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
B = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

# Use the union operator to combine the sets
print("A union B:", A | B)

# Use the intersection operator to find common elements
print("A intersection B:", A & B)

# Use the difference operator to find elements in A that are not in B
print("A - B:", A - B)

# Use the symmetric difference operator to find elements
# that are in either A or B but not both
print("A symmetric difference B:", A ^ B)

# Check if A is a subset of B
print("Is A a subset of B:", A.issubset(B))

# Check if A is a proper subset of B
print("Is A a proper subset of B:", A.issubset(B) and A != B)

# Check if A is a superset of B
print("Is A a superset of B:", A.issuperset(B))
```


------


### **Sets (Union of any number of sets) - Notation**

If {{< katex >}}A_0, A_1, A_2, \ldots{{< /katex >}} are sets, the union of these sets can be denoted as
{{< katex display>}}\bigcup \{A_i \mid i \ge 0\} = \{x \mid x \in A_i \text{ for at least one $i$ with }i \ge 0\}{{< /katex >}}

{{< katex display >}}\bigcup_{i = 0}^\infty A_i{{< /katex >}}


------

### **Sets (Power Sets)**

For a set {{< katex >}}A{{< /katex >}}, the set of all subsets of {{< katex >}}A{{< /katex >}} is called the power set. Can be denoted as {{< katex >}}\mathcal{P}(A){{< /katex >}} or as {{< katex >}}2^{A}{{< /katex >}}
- Power set of set {{< katex >}}\{a, b, c\}{{< /katex >}} is 
{{< katex display >}}\{\emptyset, \{a\}, \{b\}, \{c\}, \{a, b\}, \{a, c\}, \{b, c\}, \{a, b, c\}\}{{< /katex >}}




------
// Simple One

{{< katex display >}}\pi(x){{< /katex >}}

// Let's do formula

{{< katex display >}}
f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty\hat f(\xi)\,e^{2 \pi i \xi x}\,d\xi
{{< /katex >}}

// Let's get complicated

{{< katex display >}}
\frac{1}{\Bigl(\sqrt{\phi \sqrt{5}}-\phi\Bigr) e^{\frac25 \pi}} = 1+\frac{e^{-2\pi}} {1+\frac{e^{-4\pi}} {1+\frac{e^{-6\pi}} {1+\frac{e^{-8\pi}} {1+\cdots} } } }

{{< katex display >}}
		L^* = \{x_1x_2...x_n \mid n \in \mathbb{N}, x_1,x_2,...,x_n \in L\} = \bigcup\limits_{n \in \mathbb{N}} L^n
        %L_1L_2 = \{xy \mid x \in L_1 \wedge L_2\}
{{< /katex >}}

### **Power of n**

        L^n = \{x_1x_2...x_n \mid x_i \in L \text{ for all }  1 \leq i \leq n\}
